## Backround
This game was a collaborative effort by my fantastic team and me. We wanted to create a 2d isometric puzzle game based on the works of Earthbound and the Mother franchise. We tried to create a very kid-friendly game that all ages could enjoy that was also will give you challenges and make you use your mind. 
## Story 
Ghouls and Gobstoppers is an isometric puzzle game based on the works of Earthbound and the Mother franchise. You'll be playing as Billy, who is trying to save his neighborhood from all the ghosts that are stealing candy in the neighborhood and ruining Halloween. You will have to avoid ghosts and use Billy's magical guitar to defend yourself. You will also have access to "Ghost Vision", which can unlock hidden areas around the map. To defeat all the ghosts you need to find the four magical music sheets hidden throughout the level. If you collect all of the sheets without losing "HOPE" you will send all the ghosts back to the underworld and save Halloween.
## Controls
#### By using the ARROW KEYS you will be able to move Billy around the screen, to maneuver past the ghosts.
#### Pressing X will stun the ghosts for a short duration, allowing you time to grab items around the stage.
#### Pressing A to activate Ghost Vision. This mode allows you to go to places that were previously unreachable, but beware, ghosts can attack you while you are in this mode.
#### Using Ghost Vision is an important mechanic in the game and you will need to make sure that you use it correctly to win
#### You must collect 4 pages of Magical Sheet Music to win, so don't lose HOPE!
## Cheats
#### By pressing A you'll regain a large amount of health
#### By pressing C you can keep increasing the speed of the character
#### By pressing V you will instanly win the game (not much of a cheat is it)
